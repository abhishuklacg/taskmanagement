Documentation

This project is a document management system that allows users to interact with various document cards. Users can drag and drop documents to rearrange them, view larger versions in an overlay, and the application automatically saves changes at regular intervals.
The system uses a React frontend, with a mock API to fetch and update document data.

Key features include:
Drag-and-drop functionality for reordering documents.
Document preview overlay on click.
Automatic saving with visual feedback (spinner) when changes are detected.
